Image browsing and exif data testing

Test environment setup at http://darrgotek.com:3000/

Software is still in alpha, but works for basic drill down of exif data.

Major to dos:
Add more code comments
Move functions used more than once to helpers or control controller
Clean up loading times of front page via caching and generation of links (right now it's all 100% dynamic)
Plan out a real UI
Clean up "exclude" list for what images to show
General code clean up
