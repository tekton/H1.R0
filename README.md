Image browsing and exif data testing

Test environment setup at http://darrgotek.com/h1r0/

Software is still in alpha, but works for basic drill down of exif data.

Major to dos:

Add more code comments<br />
Move functions used more than once to helpers or control controller<br />
Clean up loading times of front page via caching and generation of links (right now it's all 100% dynamic)<br />
Plan out a real UI<br />
Clean up "exclude" list for what images to show<br />
General code clean up<br />
Change the readme to something with markup
